**International converter** aims to be an **_ALL-IN-ONE_** platform to convert things on a page that is very friendly and beautiful for the user.

For the moment this is just an MVP to have the base that I will be expanding over time

## 🛠️ Stack

The main goal of this project is to implement the React knowledge acquired. I also included Tailwind in order to have simpler and faster-developing styles that look good.
